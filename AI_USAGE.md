# AI Usage

This is a disclosure of every way AI was used in the development of this project and why.

## How has AI been used?

- To brainstorm how best to structure rules.
  > As the library expanded to include configurable rules, I wanted to see some other ideas as to how to structure and store the rules. Funnily enough, it ended up with a similar answer to what I was already thinking.

- To help revise and tweak the following files:
	- [README.md](https://github.com/TrigamDev/weave/blob/main/README.md) (and the corresponding `README.md`s of each of the packages).
	- [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/TrigamDev/weave/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
	- [COMMIT_CONVENTION.md](https://github.com/TrigamDev/weave/blob/main/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md).
	- [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/TrigamDev/weave/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
	> I wanted these files to be the best they could be and to have all the bases covered. So, AI was used to perform minor revisions, point out areas they could be improved, etc. The amount of AI writing is very minor, the vast majority of them are still human written. As well as this, AI was only used as a pass after they had been written, so the core content and structure are entirely human-made.
