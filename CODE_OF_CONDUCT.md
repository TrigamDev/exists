## Our Pledge

We pledge to make our community welcoming, safe, and equitable for all.

We are committed to fostering an environment that respects and promotes the
dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of
characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical
characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or
expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or
social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status.

The same privileges of participation are extended to everyone who participates
in good faith and in accordance with this Code of Conduct.

## Guidelines

We agree to stand by the following guidelines in our community. Violating,
threatening to violate, or encouraging violations of these guidelines is
considered a breach of this Code of Conduct.

### Be Respectful

We treat all members of this community with kindness, civility, honesty, and
respect.

While disagreements and differences in viewpoint are natural and expected, we
will handle them thoughtfully and respectfully. Viewpoints and experiences
different from our own deserve respect, even if we do not fully understand them.

We do not engage in harassment, hate speech, discrimination, or stereotyping
under any circumstances. We also do not make insulting, demeaning, or pejorative
comments directed at a community member or group of people. We aim to foster a
community that is safe and welcoming to all, and such behavior has no place
here.

### Respect Boundaries

We respect boundaries at all times. If someone expresses boundaries or requests
us to stop interacting with them in a particular way, we will honor that request
immediately and without argument.

We do not share, misuse, or act on any private or personal information without
explicit permission.

We do not sexualize others, engage in unwanted intimacy, pressure others to be
intimate, or engage in any sexual or intimate behavior involving a minor. These
behaviors are strictly forbidden, without exception.

### Minimize Drama

We avoid starting drama, escalating or continuing drama, or bringing drama in
from outside the community.

We aim to resolve disagreements calmly, privately when appropriate, and in a
timely manner. We value de-escalation and calm resolution over "winning"
arguments.

We strive to create a community that is welcoming, safe, and relaxing.
Persistent drama and negativity are exhausting and draining, and there's plenty
to be found elsewhere.

### Handle Feedback Gracefully

We give and receive constructive feedback with respect and good faith.

We offer feedback with the goal of improvement and seeing a work be the best it
can be, not to make fun of it or embarrass its creators.

When receiving feedback, we listen openly and respond thoughtfully, even when we
disagree.

### Take Responsibility

We take responsibility for our actions, decisions, words, and contributions. Our
actions are ours and ours alone, and we are responsible for everything we say
and do.

When our actions cause harm, whether intentional or unintentional, we make a
sincere and best effort to remedy the harm caused, acknowledge our
responsibility in causing it, and ensure that it is not repeated.

### Act Responsibly

We make our best effort to act responsibly and consider how our behavior impacts
others and the community as a whole.

We do not cause, encourage, or make threats of violence or other harm towards
any person or group of people.

We do not misrepresent our identity or impersonate others for any reason.

We communicate responsibly and do not share or promote content that violates
this Code of Conduct.

We act in ways that promote the well-being of our community, and avoid behavior
that threatens its safety, trust, or standards.

### Do Not Plagiarize

We respect the works and efforts of others.

We properly credit sources and do not submit content that is copied,
misrepresented, or claimed as our own without appropriate attribution.

We respect the terms of licenses associated with any work we use.

### Be Human

We value human creativity and effort.

We minimize the use of AI tools, AI agents, and other generative AI in our
contributions. All contributions are majority human-created, and any small
amount that isn't has been thoroughly reviewed by a human.

We make absolutely zero use of any generative AI in creative areas, such as art
and design. Human creativity is incredibly important, and AI cannot and should
not replace it.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they are trying their
best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a Code of Conduct violation,
and this Code of Conduct reinforces guidelines that can help avoid conflicts and
minimize harm.

When an incident does occur, it is best to report it promptly. The best ways to
report an incident are:

- Contacting a Community Moderator via our [Discord](https://dsc.gg/trigam-den).
- Directly contacting [Trigam](https://github.com/TrigamDev/) through any
  available channel of communication (Discord will result in the quickest
  response).

Community Moderators take all reports seriously and will make every effort to
respond in a timely manner. We investigate all reports of Code of Conduct
violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses
and other participants.

Community Moderators will keep investigation and enforcement actions as
transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality. In order
to honor these values, enforcement actions are carried out in private with the
involved parties, but communicating to the whole community may be part of a
mutually agreed upon resolution.

## Enforcement

If an investigation finds that this Code of Conduct has been violated, we may
apply one of the following consequences based on the severity of the violation
and our best judgment. When applicable, a consequence will include the actions
from every previous consequence.

### Warning

We issue a private, written warning describing how the Code of Conduct was
violated, what should have been done differently, and what is expected going
forward.

To any affected by their actions, the violator must provide a private, written
apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and a pledge to follow this Code of
Conduct and to not repeat their violations again in the future.

### Temporary Suspension

We may temporarily suspend the violator from making contributions and
interacting with the community.

A suspension also includes a written warning as well as conditions for the
suspension being removed, which are mutually agreed upon by us and those
affected by the violator's actions.

The violator must give a private, written apology to those affected by their
actions and follow the conditions of the suspension in order for the suspension
to be removed.

### Permanent Ban

For severe or repeated violations of this Code of Conduct, we may permanently
remove the violator from all community spaces and activities.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, within any interaction
with community members, and when an individual is representing the community in
public or other spaces.
